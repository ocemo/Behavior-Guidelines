Offenses","text":"# Name of Offence Description 1 Excessively spamming text chat with text or reactions Any instance of posting the same message, image, or gif either a. multiple times in one channel, b. once in multiple channels, or c. in multiple different CSC discords will be considered spam. This also applies to in-game chats. Reacting to many messages, in one channel or multiple channels, with the same or different reactions, can also lead to a mute. 2 Spamming voice chat/spam joining voice Repeatedly joining and leaving, or rapidly moving between, a voice channel in the CSC discord will warrant a punishment for spam joining. You may also be warned under this rule for any instance of voice changers or loud sounds played in a voice channel. 3 General misuse of channels Any messages that divert from the intended topic of a channel, such as regular discussion in #ask-a-coach or #introductions. 4 Baiting other community members Creating unnecessary drama, manipulation of others, or being overly judgmental or critical of others, especially when done to generate a reaction from someone. Includes attacks or insults through in-game chat. 5 Falsely/incorrectly reporting scores Intentionally lying in a score report to either misrepresent the correct score or reporting the wrong winner will be warned under this rule. 6 Pinging roles between 3am-10am EST Self explanitory. 7 Unnecessary pings Pinging small roles for no apparent reason. This can also apply to pinging individuals if they complain. 8 Non-English text in chat Self explanitory. 9 Excessive pinging Spam pinging an individual. 10 Being generally disrespectful, rude or toxic to community members This refers to harassment of other players, including, but not limited to: verbal insults, text insults, and repeated, overt sarcastic responses in both text or voice chat. This can include DMs brought to the attention of the moderators. It is primarily up to moderator discretion whether or not to punish for this. 48 Suggestive Media Posting any images, gifs, text, or videos that can be considered not safe for work (NSFW) but are not explicit or graphic. This is including but not limited to innuendos, suggestive content or sexual references (graphic or implied)"},{"location":"detailed-misbehavior-descriptions/#normal-offenses","title":"Normal Offenses","text":"# Name of Offence Description 11 Explicit Conversations Conversations referring to sex or any topic that might make a movie rated R. Many of us in CSC are adults. Many of us are not. Nobody is here to hear random rated-R tales. There is near-zero reason for these topics to be discussed. 12 Pinging a role without approval Pinging roles, such as Event Interest, without approval will warrant an immediate mute unless approved by admins or blanket permission has been given to a staff role (ex. Media does not need approval to ping stream interest when announcing a stream). 13 Collaborating in Commiting Minor Misbehaviors Any confirmed efforts to work together to commit misbehaviors. Strikes in this area are applied to all applicable members involved who have been shown to actively participate in preparing for the infraction(s). 14 General conduct detrimental to CSC Any conduct that a new user would be turned away by seeing can be punished. This is a blanket rule for moderator discretion. 15 Asking for specific punishments for others Requesting, in public, that someone be muted for breaking a rule. Please use tickets for player reports. At Mod discretion, you may instead receive exactly what you asked for, applied to you, and additional strikes may be incurred. 16 NSFW media Posting any images, gifs, or videos that are considered not safe for work (NSFW) or other public locations due to nudity, sexual content, gore, extreme violence, or other aspects. Drastically or overtly explicit materials will instantly incur 3 strikes. 17 Swearing directed at another member Self explanitory. 18 False accusations of serious offence Publicly accusing a member of harassment when no such thing has been done, for example, would warrant a mute under this rule. 19 Public accusation of staff abuse Publicly accusing a Mod of abuse for muting you, for example, would warrant a mute under this rule. This can also cover baseless accusations made in tickets. 20 Encouraging drama or rule breaking, or promising to do so Any discovered attempts to encourage or bait other members into committing offences, or statements confirming intent to do so. Continuing or reigniting hostile conversations, making false accusations, saying you will intentionally break rules, etc. may also fall under this rule. 21 Testing, taunting, or baiting mods Trying a mods patience, whether it be by pushing limits outside, or within, other rulebreaking, trying to garner a negative reaction from a staff member, or trying to bait mods into levying punishments. 22 Posting spam links Any posting of links to untrusted/unknown sites or repeated posting of links (i.e. other discord links). If evidence indicates malicious intent, this is instantly elevated to a ban under Rule #41. 23 Discussing politics, religion, or other serious real-life topics in bad faith Discussions regarding politics, religion, or other controversial or otherwise serious real-life topics in bad faith or an offensive manner. Attacking others in conversations related to these topics will likely receive strikes. 24 Harrassment Repeated insulting of another member, even after being asked to stop."},{"location":"detailed-misbehavior-descriptions/#serious-offenses","title":"Serious Offenses","text":"# Name of Offence Description 25 Retaliating Against Staff or Members Lashing out against someone as a response to something they have done, whether it be cutting you, punishing you, reporting you, etc. 26 Impersonating Members of Staff Any attempt to assume the role of another member or staff. This includes staff members, committee roles, or other elevated roles. Impersonation can be done through name changes, profile pictures, steam profiles, or other profiles. 27 False accusations of serious offence towards staff Any accusation of serious nature that requires a discussion or high level investigation found to be blatantly false will give a punishment for false accusations. This is mainly found in false reports of abuse. 28 Continued harassment of community members Harassment continued against the same member after a strike under Rule 24 will warrant an immediate strike for this rule in place of a second Rule 24 strike. 29 Creating a troll discord account Creating a discord account solely to cause trouble in the CSC discord, or any related discord, will result in a ban of the troll account and a strike for the creator. 30 Timing misbehaviors to minimize punishments Any revealed attempts to time potential misbehaviors in such a way as to minimize punishments, such as counting the days until a strike is removed then immediately getting another one. 31 Spoiling recent shows or movies (within 2 weeks of release) Defined as intentionally revealing information about recent media (shows, movies, etc. that have come out in the past two weeks) that can spoil the enjoyment of members who are interested in that media, but have not been able to see it yet. 32 Collaborating in Committing Normal or Serious Misbehaviors Any confirmed efforts to work together to commit misbehaviors. Strikes in this area are applied to all applicable members involved who have been shown to actively participate in preparing for the infraction(s). 33 Stream sniping or bug exploiting Watching CSC streams, whether it be an opposing player or the official stream while showcased, while in match. Bug exploiting applies to game breaking bugs or exploits and is reviewed by Admins on a case by case basis. Please make a ticket for accusations of bug exploits or stream sniping."},{"location":"detailed-misbehavior-descriptions/#other-offenses","title":"Other Offenses","text":"# Name of Offence Description 34 Bypassing, or attempting to bypass, punishments in bad faith Any attempts to subvert existing punishments, or to prevent infractions being reported and punished.

Resending deleted messages will result in a double strike. Any successful attempt to avoid automod with banned words will be treated as a 37. - --------------- ----------- 10M1 Dodging a game Intentionally dodging a game after ready check has popped. Multiple instances of accidental dodges will also lead to a strike. 10M2 General toxicity Intentional rude behavior, including but not limited to insults, disrupting communications, and chat spams. 10M3 Leaving/afking a game in progress Intentionally leaving a 10man and not returning, or going afk and not playing.

GM2 Abusing player trust Taking actions that take advantage of the trust that players place in GMs, purposefully making use of that trust in a way that is against player desires or expectations. GM3 Failure to address player concerns Choosing not to take action on player concerns or reports within a franchise. GM4 Misuse of position Taking actions that are not in good faith and in line with the GM position they were entrusted with. An example would include drafting a team of only your friends without any intention of being competitive. GM5 Abuse of position Taking actions that result in misleading or confusing players intentionally. An example would include telling an opposing player that a match has been rescheduled when it has not. GM6 Extended, unexplained inactivity with no backup plan A GM going dark with no explanation, without informing anyone, or having any backup plan in case this were to occur. S1 Misuse of position Taking actions that are not in good faith and in line with the position they were entrusted with. An example would be using the Events role to ping players to play in a tournament not affiliated with CSC. S2 Abuse of position Taking actions that fall completely out of line of player trust. An example would be taking payment or something similar in exchange of a player being featured more often on Reddit, in media, or having a better position in a tournament. S3 Leaking privileged information Leaking priveleged information to anyone that did not previously have access. This can apply to non-staff players if involved. CH1 Misuse of position Taking actions that are not in good faith and in line with the position they were entrusted with. An example would include adding people without clear motivation or skills into their committee.
